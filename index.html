						## COVID Case Study

						<h3>Project Description</h3>
						<p>We wish to create a descriptive narrative of factors impacting COVID deaths in various world countries.  Our descriptive narrative will include visualizations and appropriate statistics which show which factors were most important in helping a country do relatively well or relatively poorly with COVID mortality.  By identifying the most important factors related to COVID mortality, we will then prescribe certain steps for countries to take if a similar airborne virus caused another pandemic in the future.
						</p>

						<h3>Main Questions</h3>
						<p>
							<ul>
								<li>What are the primary factors that influence COVID mortality in a country?</li>
								<li>How do the primary factors interact with each other?  Can we leave some primary factor(s) out and still have a good regression model?</li>
								<li>What lessons can we learn from the data?  What can countries do to improve the outcome if there is another pandemic similar to the COVID pandemic?</li>
							</ul>

							Our primary dataset came from Our World In Data (OWID):

							https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data

							We decided to use this dataset as OWID curates their data from reputable sources including research from Johns Hopkins University (JHU), the United Nations, the World Bank, and many others. Another major reason for using this dataset is the plethora of variables available for use in our analysis ranging from the number of confirmed cases and deaths on any given day, to testing, hospitalization, and vaccination rates, as well as many other demographic variables such as human development index and comorbidity factor indexes.

							Our first dataset involved looking at COVID deaths per million in individual countries as of June 8th, 2022.  Using this “snapshot” dataset, we wanted to see if categorical variables (such as whether or not a country imposed a lockdown) were associated with COVID mortality rates. We also desired to know if quantitative but “static” type variables (such as diabetes prevalence in a country or that country’s population density) had any relationship with how each country fared in keeping COVID deaths down.

							Our second dataset involved looking at COVID deaths per million over time.  This time series data allowed us to see how different continuous variables were related to its COVID mortality rate. An important note with variables such as confirmed cases and deaths are that they are collected by date of report, rather than date of test/death. Therefore the number does not necessarily represent the actual number on a given date. This means that our data over time can show sudden changes (negative or positive) when a country corrects historical data, because it had previously under- or overestimated the number of cases/deaths. This plays an important part in our time-series analysis later.

							### ANOVA
						</textarea>
					</section>
					
					<section>
						<p>One of the most interesting questions we hoped to answer with our chosen data was the effect of lockdowns – did they help individual countries to keep their COVID mortality rates down?  We used an ANOVA model to test three different categories of lockdown – full, partial, and none.  
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<img src="/visualizations/Lockdown_ANOVA_Model.png" alt="ANOVA Modeling of Lockdown Types">
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Interestingly, countries which employed a full lockdown had significantly higher COVID mortality rates (on average) than countries which had no lockdown whatsoever.  This may be a counterintuitive result, but considering that countries with more COVID deaths may have been more motivated to try to use lockdowns to stem the number of deaths than countries which weren’t affected as much early on by the disease, the result is not entirely surprising.
						</p>
					</section>
					
					<section>
						<p>Along with lockdown types, we were also interested in analyzing how different continents fared when it came to COVID mortality rates.
						</p>						
					</section>
					<section>
						<img src="/visualizations/Continent_ANOVA_Model.png" alt="ANOVA Modeling of Continents">
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Based on the results of the model, it appears that countries in South America and Europe had the highest COVID mortality rates on average.  North American countries had a lower mortality rate (on average) than South American and European countries, but a higher mortality rate (on average) than countries in Asia, Africa, and Oceania.  
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>South America’s results may have been skewed by the country of Peru, which had a much higher rate of COVID deaths per million than was to be expected given its other variables (more on that later).  The countries of Europe, on the other hand, may have been more afflicted with COVID mortality – especially early on in the pandemic – due to relative amounts of international travel in and out of Europe (although this was not something we could directly measure with our dataset).
