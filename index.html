							<h3>Project Description</h3>
							<p>We wish to create a descriptive narrative of factors impacting COVID deaths in various world countries.  Our descriptive narrative will include visualizations and appropriate statistics which show which factors were most important in helping a country do relatively well or relatively poorly with COVID mortality.  By identifying the most important factors related to COVID mortality, we will then prescribe certain steps for countries to take if a similar airborne virus caused another pandemic in the future.
							</p>

							<h3>Main Questions</h3>
							<p>
								<ul>
									<li>What are the primary factors that influence COVID mortality in a country?</li>
									<li>How do the primary factors interact with each other?  Can we leave some primary factor(s) out and still have a good regression model?</li>
									<li>What lessons can we learn from the data?  What can countries do to improve the outcome if there is another pandemic similar to the COVID pandemic?</li>
								</ul>
