						<h3>Project Description</h3>
						<p>We wish to create a descriptive narrative of factors impacting COVID deaths in various world countries.  Our descriptive narrative will include visualizations and appropriate statistics which show which factors were most important in helping a country do relatively well or relatively poorly with COVID mortality.  By identifying the most important factors related to COVID mortality, we will then prescribe certain steps for countries to take if a similar airborne virus caused another pandemic in the future.
						</p>

						<h3>Main Questions</h3>
						<p>
							<ul>
								<li>What are the primary factors that influence COVID mortality in a country?</li>
								<li>How do the primary factors interact with each other?  Can we leave some primary factor(s) out and still have a good regression model?</li>
								<li>What lessons can we learn from the data?  What can countries do to improve the outcome if there is another pandemic similar to the COVID pandemic?</li>
							</ul>

							### Socioeconomic Variables

						<p>In the above visualization, we created a 3D scatterplot of KMean clusters based on socioeconomic variables. During our ANOVA testing and regression analysis research we found life expectancy, GDP per capita, and population density to be strong variables in determining which countries could be grouped together by socioeconomic status. From here, our goal is to then run ARIMA models on the different socioeconomic groupings in order to forecast the effect of COVID on different socioeconomic statuses.

					<section style="text-align: justify;">
						<p>In the above visualization, we created another 3D scatterplot of KMean clusters but this time based on some of the numeric COVID-related variables. We found that the percentage of people totally vaccinated as well as the total case and death numbers per million to be strong variables in determining which countries could be grouped together. From these groupings, we will run additional ARIMA models on the different groupings in order to forecast the effect of COVID on different countries based on the size of their vaccinated population.

							### Comorbidity Variables

					</section>
					<section style="text-align: justify;">
						<p>In the above visualization, we see another 3D plot which takes into consideration comorbidity variables. Among these variables, we found diabetes prevalance, cardiovascular death rate, and the percentage of the population that was over 65 years old to be variables that would aid us in determining which countries could be grouped together by the vulnerability of their populations. Like the previous slides, we will be running ARIMA models on these different comorbidity groupings in order to forecast the effect of COVID on populations with different levels of vulnerability.

							### Principle Component Analysis

					</section>
					<section style="text-align: justify;">
						<p>In the above visualization, we created... wait for it... another 3D scatterplot of KMean clusters but this is different due to it being based on principle component analysis and not direct variables. We have yet to dig into what these different components might be or if we are even able to, however, we felt that representing the different ways we can approach feature selection with our data is valuable nonentheless.
