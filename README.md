In this project, my team and I created a descriptive narrative of factors impacting COVID deaths in various world countries.  Our descriptive narrative includes visualizations and appropriate statistics showing which factors were most important in helping a country do relatively well or relatively poorly with COVID mortality.  By identifying the most important factors related to COVID mortality, we then prescribed certain steps for countries to take if a similar airborne virus caused another pandemic in the future.

We also sought to answer the following questions:
* What are the primary factors that influence COVID mortality in a country?
* How do the primary factors interact with each other?  Can we leave some primary factor(s) out and still have a good regression model?
* What lessons can we learn from the data?  What can countries do to improve the outcome if there is another pandemic similar to the COVID pandemic?
